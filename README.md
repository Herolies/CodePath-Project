## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [https://www.w3schools.com/ , https://www.freecodecamp.org/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [Understanding the logic when trying to get it to fail or win the game. Took a bit longer than it should. Decided to take a peek on the examople
   on what was giving. It was very similar to the point that I changed it to be the same as is. It was working orginally though it brakes near the end.
   Other than that, thought it was a fun expiernce.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [Understranding better on JavaScript and what else you can do to manipulate the page and how the use interacts with it.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [Incresing the diffcuttly for each turn or give the user an option on how hard or easy they want the game to be. Adding different game modes, etc.]
